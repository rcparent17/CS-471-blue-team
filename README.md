# Motorcycle Shop Software

## Development Setup

This project uses a minimum version of `python 3.6`.
Formatting rules are simply to use `black`. To install black, open a terminal
and type either

``` bash
pip3 install --user black
```

or

``` bash
pip install --user black
```

additionally, check whether `python` or `python3` is the name of your Python
interpreter. You can do this by running `python --version` and
`python3 --version`. If you don't have `python3` as a thing you can run, then
`python` is probably the correct interpreter, you should be using `pip` instead
of `pip3` to install packages.
